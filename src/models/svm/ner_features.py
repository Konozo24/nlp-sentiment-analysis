"""Per-token features for the SVM's NER tagger.

TF-IDF is a whole-document bag-of-words representation with no per-token
structure, so it can't feed a sequence tagger directly. This reframes NER as
per-token classification instead: a small hand-crafted feature vector per
word, the classical (pre-neural) answer to sequence tagging with a linear
classifier. sklearn.feature_extraction.DictVectorizer turns these dicts into
the sparse matrix LinearSVC needs.
